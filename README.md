# Cue And Cope

This project was for DementiaHack - a hackathon to create life-improving hardware and software solutions for those living with dementia and their caregivers. 

Cue and Cope is an application built using WebRTC and React that helps caregivers and loved ones talk to a person with dementia using a mobile device. Our team identified that loneliness and social isolation was a common problem with people living with dementia and our solution was to make an application that helps with communication between loved ones and a person with dementia. Our idea was to make a tablet that had no user interaction from the person with dementia because we want to make an application that was very simple to use so our idea was to have the tablet fixed to a wall where the person with dementia lives and the tablet would play video recordings from loved ones, play reminders through videos, and interact with their loved ones through real time communication. If a person with dementia routinely forgets an activity, the video reminder would loop every 5 minutes telling them of the activity.
